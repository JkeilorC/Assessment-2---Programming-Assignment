AI Conversation Assistance
Here I record some of the assitance that I have received from AI.
Conversation 1:
Given the URL for the weather data, how is the infromation stored?
AI response: 
The Response Format
The API returns data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) â€” a hierarchical structure made up of nested dictionaries and lists.
In Python, when you do:

response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

then data becomes a Python dictionary that looks roughly like this:
{
  "data": {
    "request": [
      {"type": "City", "query": "Sydney, Australia"}
    ],
    "current_condition": [
      {
        "temp_C": "18",
        "weatherDesc": [{"value": "Partly cloudy"}],
        "humidity": "67",
        "windspeedKmph": "15",
        "precipMM": "0.2",
        ...
      }
    ],
    "weather": [
      {
        "date": "2025-10-19",
        "maxtempC": "23",
        "mintempC": "15",
        "avgtempC": "19",
        "hourly": [
          {
            "time": "0",
            "tempC": "16",
            "precipMM": "0.0",
            "humidity": "72",
            ...
          },
          {
            "time": "300",
            "tempC": "15",
            "precipMM": "0.0",
            ...
          }
          # more hourly readings here
        ]
      },
      # Next forecast day...
    ]
  }
}
Comment: This converstaion allowed me to see in which nests the required information was stored.
