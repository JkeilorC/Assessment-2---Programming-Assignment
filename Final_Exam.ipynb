        "Each refinement applied strengthened the task manager algorithm, improving the design. This applies principles from Week 2 (Pseudocode & Control Structures), focusing on clarity, consistent indentation, and explicit branching logic. In the first refinement, I used more detailed input validation and clear loop structures, reflecting the course emphasis on structured problem-solving and defensive programming. The second refinement applied the Week 4 content on Creating Modular Designs and enhancing code, reducing complexity while maintaining the logic as readable and modular as possible. The evolution between versions demonstrates the application of iterative development from Week 2, where solutions are progressively refined based on the requirements. I also aligned the menu-driven structure with Week 5 examples on user interaction loops, ensuring the main control flow is simple and predictable. Week 3 (Testing and Refining the Weather Forecaster) also provides important information on testing and refining the code to make the program more concise without compromising its output. The main refinement occurs in the first step, where the pseudocode defines error outputs. Without these, the program could crash instead of providing a proper message addressing the bug. Overall, the final pseudocode demonstrates how core course ideas—structured logic, modular design, and iterative refinement—were applied to produce a cleaner, more efficient task-management algorithm.\n",
